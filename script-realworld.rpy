    me "Mhm..."
    me "I've never know forcing you into reality was like that! Now that you are real, I don't need to turn on my PC to have you by my side."

    "I strike up a conversation with him. We're just here."
    me "Glad my father is not here to see this...he would certainly worry too much about that PC'S health to make sure the C local drive isn't low, or the PC's speed isn't slow..."
    me "I think he shouldn't worry too much after all, he tried hard for getting the money to buy this PC and Allah knows what he would do if that PC is devastated."
    k 1a "It's good that he wants to take care of it and make sure everything's running smoothly."

    "{i}(At least that 'imanimate object' you are referring to, has helped me on my life a lot.){/i}"

    "I want to say no, but let's not dissapoint him."
    "Let's change the subject."
    me "How have you been so good at coding to build that world in my PC for us live there!?"
    me "I think we are now in real world, but I don't want your exertions to be ignored, I might as well go there working with like that's my third-party world!"
    "How thoughtful I am..."
    k "Oh uh, well, thank you. I'm glad you think I did a good job creating that virtual world. It was quite the effort to make, but I enjoyed every moment of it. {w=2.0}{nw}"
    extend 2a " As for going there together, let me just say..."
    k 1a "With my coding skills, {w=2.0}{nw}"
    extend 4a "I could make anything you want happen in that virtual world."
    me "No, You don't have to wear yourself out too much by that! That's enough, though, I don't let my greed win over my logic... I'm decent here."
    "I learned that 'I don't let my greed win over my logic' line from Saeed Walkover."
    k 1a "Hey, don't worry about me. I'm not wearing myself out by coding all of that, I enjoy it. But, if you say you're content with how things are, then I won't push you any further."
    k "I just...want to make things perfect for you, you know? I want to make your desires come true, and make this world exactly how you want it to be. That's what {b}best friends{/b} do, right?"
    "Oh god..."
    "How can this little axolotl be so cute?"
    me "You are too kind~"
